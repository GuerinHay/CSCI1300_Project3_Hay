# CSCI1300_Project3_Hay
Project Three (Dungeons and Dragons text based RPG) for CSCI 1300.

OVERVIEW

  In this project I use early C++ concepts such as simple loops, array memory allocation, and switches to create a 
text based RPG loosely based on Dungeons and Dragons. Players can expect a variety of encounters whilst playing the game,
including but not limited to: NPC encounters (friendly and hostile), boss battles scaling in difficulty towards the end of the game,
as well as riddles that can be encountered along the adventure. 

  This game also has a fully implemented player armor and health system, as well as an inventory system that can be filled with items 
from exploring, as well as from encountering friendly NPC merchants. Players can cook food, buy armor, sell treasure and more!

Note that this project does not use pointers, or any complex data structures (such as linked lists, BST, etc.) for that matter.
